## Lecture - 7 Summary
### Topic : Reference Variables & Typecasting

By default the scope of each variable is local , to call the global variable we use `::` scope resolution operator .<br>
By default decimal literal _( e.g. 3.45 )_ is `double` to let the compiler know that given number is float we use `f or F` suffix _( e.g. 3.45f )_.<br>
Same goes with `long` .
```c++
float = 3.45f;
long double = 3.45l; //This is long double, this doesn't exist in java.
```
To know the size of a datatype we use `sizeof()` keyword , enter the value in parenthesis which you want to check.<br>
>Note: The size of a datatype differs compiler to compiler.

**Reference Variable** : In short words , we can say a man with multiple names but all those names belong to single person and when we call with any name that is related to that person ,that person will respond to the call .

**Code:**
```c++
int main(){

    int a =45;
    int &b = a;

    cout<<"Output of a : "<<a<<endl;
    cout<<"Output of b : "<<b<<endl;
    b = 50;
    cout<<"Output of a : "<<a<<endl;

    return 0; 
}
```
**Output:**
```
Output of a : 45
Output of b : 45
Output of a : 50
```

**TypeCasting** : The term is enough to explain it concept. In simple words, the process of converting one datatype into another datatype manually.<br>
```c++
float b = 55.67;
int c = (int)b;
```
