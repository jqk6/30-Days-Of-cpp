## Lecture - 14 Summary
### Topic : Structures, Unions & Enums in C++

**What is Structures ?**
>It is a user defined data type which is available in C++ (not present in JAVA).
>And it is used to compile heterogenous data types. Structures are different from arrays because in **arrays** we store similar datatype elements on the otherhand when we want to compile different datatypes elements together we use **Structures**.


```c++
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    
    struct employee
    {
        int eID ;
        float salary;

    };


    int main(){
        
        struct employee rohan;
        rohan.eID =1;
        rohan.salary = 25000;
    return 0;
    }
```




**typedef** 
keyword in C++ is used for aliasing existing data types, user-defined data types, and pointers to a more meaningful name. `typedef` allow you to give descriptive names to standard data types, which can also help you self-document your code.
>NOTE: typedef is part of User-defined datatypes too.

Taking the above example, the code will look like this:<br>
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

    typedef struct employee
    {
        int eID ;
        float salary;

    }ep;


    int main(){
        
        ep rohan;
        rohan.eID =1;
        rohan.salary = 25000;
    return 0;
    }
``` 
Using `typedef` is not necessary it's upto you if you want to use it or not.

**What is Union ?**<br>
>Union are better in terms of memeory management.<br>
>A union is a user-defined type in which all members share the same memory location. This definition means that at any given time, a union can contain no more than one object from its list of members.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

union quantity
{
    int apple;
    int mango;
    float rice;
};

int main(){

  union quantity q1;
  q1.apple = 10;
  cout<<"The quantity of apples is : "<<q1.apple<<endl;  
return 0;
}
```
**Output :**
```
The quantity of apples is : 10
```

But things will be different when we try to assign values  in more than one element of union and accessing them.
```c++
union quantity
{
    int apple;
    int mango;
    float rice;
};

int main(){

  union quantity q1;
  q1.apple = 10;
  q1.mango = 20;
  cout<<"The quantity of apples is : "<<q1.apple<<endl;  
return 0;
}

```
**Output :**
```
The quantity of apples is : 20
```

The value of apple is overriden by mango values. Means one value is shared between all elements of **Union** and only the latest values will be accessed just like above example.

**There is one interesting thing 🤯**
```c++
union quantity
{
    int apple;
    int mango;
    char favChar;
};

int main(){

  union quantity q1;
  q1.apple = 10;
  q1.mango = 20;
  
  cout<<"The quantity of apples is : "<<q1.apple<<endl;  

  //One interesting thing
  q1.favChar ='c';
  cout<<"The quantity of mango is : "<<q1.mango<<endl;  
  
  cout<<"The value of favChar is : "<<q1.favChar<<endl; 
return 0;
}
```
Now the latest overriden value is 'c' and the [ASCII](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html) value of 'c' is 99.<br>
**Output :**
```
The quantity of apples is : 20
The quantity of mango is : 99
The value of favChar is : c
```
This shows us that typecasting is also happens between other datatypes in **Union**.

**What are Enums in C++ ?**
>Enumerated type (enumeration) or enums is a user-defined data type which can be assigned some limited values. These values are defined by the programmer at the time of declaring the enumerated type.<br>
If we assign a float value in a character value, then the compiler generates an error. In the same way if we try to assign any other value to the enumerated data types, the compiler generates an error. Enumerator types of values are also known as enumerators. It is also assigned by zero the same as the array. It can also be used with switch statements.

**Syntax :**<br>
```
enum enumerated-type-name{value1, value2, value3…..valueN};
```

By default, the starting code value of the first element of enum is 0 (as in the case of array) . But it can be changed explicitly.

For example:<br>
```
enum enumerated-type-name{value1=1, value2 = 10, value3=40};
```
<br><br>
```c++
int main(){
    enum Meal{breakfast,lunch,dinner};
    
    cout<<breakfast<<endl;
    cout<<lunch<<endl;
    cout<<dinner<<endl;
return 0;
}
```
<br><br>
enum variables can also be used as datatypes.
```c++
int main(){
    enum Meal{breakfast,lunch,dinner};
    Meal m1 = breakfast;
    Meal m2 = dinner;
    
return 0;
}
```
